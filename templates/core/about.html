          <p>
            I'm Brian Kelly, and I've lived in Ayrshire my whole life. Born and raised in
            Kilmarnock, I've watched this community through its ups and downs — and I've
            always believed the best stories are the ones happening right on our doorstep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loudoun Proud started with a simple idea: what if there was one place where you
            could find out what's actually going on around here? Not the national news with
            a Scottish angle, but the real local stuff — the new cafe opening on King Street,
            the school fundraiser in Galston, the planning application that might affect your
            street.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every week, I put together a newsletter that gives you the stories that matter to
            folk who live here. It takes about 5 minutes to read, and it's completely free. No
            clickbait, no doom-scrolling — just what's happening in your backyard, told by
            someone who genuinely cares about this place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're in Stewarton or Troon, Darvel or Irvine, Ayr or anywhere in
            between — this is your newsletter. Welcome to Loudoun Proud.
